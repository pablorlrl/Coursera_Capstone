Imagine that we want to go to New York for our holidays and we want to know how to choose an airbnb to stay a few days. Well in my project, I will compare the airbnbs in New York City and determine how similar or dissimilar they are based in pricing and neighbour criminality because we also want a peaceful stay. For that i have researched for 2 databases. one with the prices and another with the criminality. The objective is to merge them and fit a model for this resolution.
